# Cancer Diagnosis Classification Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on clinical features. The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](<insert_kaggle_link_here>) and is intended for educational and training purposes.

## Description

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of cancer diagnoses. By exploring various classification methods, this project demonstrates the practical applications of machine learning in the healthcare sector.

## Dataset

The dataset contains a variety of clinical features related to breast cancer diagnosis, including:

- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Symmetry

The target variable, `diagnosis`, indicates whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset.
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and scaled features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** Implemented multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier, with cross-validation.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- **Visualizations:** Provided graphical representations of results, feature importance, and class distributions.

## Installation
